## Where to live in NYC

In this project, we want to help New Yorkers find the best neighborhood to buy an apartment. We believe that there is already a lot of information out there to help you choose by location and size of apartment but what about other features that would not be specific to apartment characteristics? 

Today people are more concerned with the environment than ever before. This is why we decided to include factors such as Energy Efficiency of Buildings as well as Farmers Markets. This project can be extended to include even more features, yet we believe that we can help people make better informed decision seamlessly.  

A brief peak at our results for Manhattan would tell you to buy an appartment in Midtown as it is the best combination of low greenhouse gas emissions and low selling price.

## Guide to our code

To check out our results, you can view our full paper in our repository. 
Most of our code was implemented in Google Colaboratory. Therefore, you can view it using the following links:

All the data to run these notebooks are accessible in the following Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Kl_PydAoEz2yJfA0bt7WHpNmOifPcpDA?usp=sharing

Our sales predictions however were run using iPython Notebook, you can download the code (Sales Predictions.ipynb) and the data required to run it in our repository.
